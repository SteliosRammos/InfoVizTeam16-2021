# Information Visualization Meetings

## Serving with Node.js

To host the visualization locally follow these steps:
-  Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), either [directly](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) or via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- Make sure `app` is the working directory: `cd app`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Launch the server: `node index.js`

## Meeting 11/02/2020

- **Presented main idea:** using OmniArt dataset to create a map of Europe/World containing different artist through time and space. We also use the object tags.

- **Feedback:** 

  - Not enough content for the whole project, we could include a control panel to filter aggregations, tags, styles... and add a second screen comparing two categories, controlled by a user defined model with the purpose of understanding the interactions between two categories.

  - The data is not completely clean, we might want to filter the content for clarity

- **Ending thoughs:**

  - We would use D3 to create an Information Visualization project
  - We should download the data and decide what we can use 
  - Set up the repo invite and notes
  - Create a path to a MVP
